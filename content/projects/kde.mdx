This project showcases a Python-based implementation of Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), a non-parametric way to estimate the probability density function of a random variable. It includes visualization of the smooth density curve over raw data, and supports different kernels and bandwidth selection methods.

Useful for statistical analysis, data science exploration, and understanding smoothing techniques in machine learning.
