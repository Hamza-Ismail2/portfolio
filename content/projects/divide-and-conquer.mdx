This project demonstrates the Karatsuba algorithm, an efficient divide-and-conquer approach to multiply large integers faster than traditional methods. Useful for understanding algorithmic optimization and the power of recursion in computational mathematics. Includes sample inputs, outputs, and time complexity analysis.
